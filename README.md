# pyside2-qml-examples

There are very few examples online of QML using PySide2 as a backend, so I decided to start collecting
some simple ones while I learn this technology.
I think QML is a great idea that clearly separates logic from presentation, so hopefully people in VFX and Animation will start using it (instead of the QtDesigner ui to py conversion madness).
