# pyside2-qml-examples

There are very few examples online of Qt QML 2 using PySide2 as a backend, so I decided to start collecting
some simple ones while I learn this technology.

I think QML is a great idea that clearly separates logic from presentation, so hopefully people in VFX and Animation will start using it (_instead of handling all of the .ui to .py autogenerated code madness_).

Also, the fact that Qt Quick 2 is using a [scene graph](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtquick-visualcanvas-scenegraph.html) makes it much more interesting for performance hungry applications, such as node editors, etc..
